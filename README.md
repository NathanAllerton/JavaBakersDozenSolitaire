# Java Bakers Dozen Solitaire
Distract yourself for five minutes by playing my Baker's Dozen version of Solitaire. I made this for the semester long project of a Software Engineering class.

This was a group project in which we had to go through the entire process of developing an application just as how it is done in other software development companies. We had to create storyboards, UML Models, and organize sprints.

The project was also an excellent way to utilize data structures. The 2 primary data structures we used were heaps and stacks.

To use this, you need a link to the video, and you need to capture a still from the video yourself by fullscreening the video and using the snipping tool delayed by 2 seconds.
