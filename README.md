# Java Bakers Dozen Solitaire
Distract yourself for five minutes by playing my Baker's Dozen version of Solitaire. I made this for the semester long project of a Software Engineering class.

This was a group project in which we had to go through the entire process of developing an application just as how it is done in other software development companies. We had to create storyboards, UML Models, and organize sprints.
